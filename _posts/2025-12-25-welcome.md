Welcome to my blog! This is a simple, minimalist blog built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software engineering practices
- Technical challenges and solutions
- Tools and technologies I'm exploring
- Thoughts on building better software

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a great choice for a developer blog because:

1. **Simple** - Just write in Markdown
2. **Fast** - Static site generation means quick load times
3. **Free hosting** - GitHub Pages hosts Jekyll sites for free
4. **Version controlled** - Your blog is a git repository

## Getting Started

Writing a new post is as easy as creating a new Markdown file in the `_posts` directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

Stay tuned for more posts!
